# Maine-eDNA

The [Maine-eDNA](https://umaine.edu/edna/) project is a 5-year research, education and outreach program that seeks to transform our understanding and sustainability of Maineâ€™s coastal ecosystems via environmental DNA (eDNA) innovations and state-wide multi-institutional collaboration. This project brings together several of the state's public and private academic institutions and independent research laboratories to focus on a shared goal of applying eDNA approaches to understand coastal ecosystem dynamics across spatial and temporal scales. The vision of Maine-eDNA is to show how the eDNA approach can transform how aquatic ecosystems are studied and managed.
